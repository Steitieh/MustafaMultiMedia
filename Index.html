        Welcome to my website! This is a simple website I made for my multimedia project. <br />
        <div style="font-size: larger">
          For my project I edited a random video of me playing overwatch, a random sentence I was saying and a drawing I drew.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size: xx-large;">
        Before we go any further, I just want to say that this website is not meant to be taken seriously. It is a simple website made for a  project and I am not a professional web developer. I'm actually very bad and now that I've warned you and I cannot be held accountable for any of my actions you may see.<br />
